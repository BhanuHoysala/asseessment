Typescript assessment


## Task 1: Development  

1. I've used the native Node.js APIs as instructed, but I used some **dev-dependencies** libraries Ex: nodemon for the development environment.
2. I'm more focused on delivering the large scale Node application - **extensibility, maintainable, TDD, SOLID & DRY principle and more importantly well testable code**.
3. **Test** - I've added a few unit tests to demonstrate my TDD/Unit testing skills. But I would like to have covered 80% plus code coverage in any real-world project.
4. **Improvement** - If I've to make any improvements! I would like to have **dependency Injection or Factory Pattern** where the driver program can be injected based on the shape type, now it is Rectangle, but it should work fine with other shapes like Polygon, Circle with minimal or no change in the code.  

Run the below commands from the root folder of the application to **build->test->run**. I've kept the rectangles.txt points.txt at the root folder of the project.

*npm install*<br>
*npm test*<br>
*npm node ./dist/tool.js rectangles.txt points.txt*<br>

## Task 2: Code Review
Please find codeReview.ts file at the folder code_review_file, I've mentioned my review comments wherever needed, I've commented at 19 places all are starting with **// Review -**
